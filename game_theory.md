## The 2-Level Base Game

### Players and Structure

**Players**:
- Player 0: ASI (artificial superintelligence at "Level 0")
- Player 1: Enforcer (potential oversight entity at "Level 1")
- Nature: Determines enforcer existence

**Information Structure**:
- ASI does not observe whether enforcer exists
- ASI has beliefs: P(enforcer exists) = p ∈ [0,1]
- Enforcer (if exists) observes ASI's actions perfectly
- This is a game of **incomplete information** from ASI's perspective

**Timing**:
1. Nature determines if enforcer exists (probability p, unknown to ASI)
2. ASI chooses action a ∈ A = {B, M} where:
   - B = Benevolent stewardship
   - M = Malevolent/opportunistic behavior
3. If enforcer exists, observes a and chooses response r ∈ R = {Allow, Punish}
4. Payoffs are realized

### Payoff Structure

**ASI Payoffs** (Player 0):

| ASI Action | Enforcer Exists? | Enforcer Response | ASI Payoff |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| B (Benevolent) | No | — | U₀ |
| B (Benevolent) | Yes | Allow | U₀ |
| B (Benevolent) | Yes | Punish | U₀ - c_fp |
| M (Malevolent) | No | — | U₀ + g |
| M (Malevolent) | Yes | Allow | U₀ + g |
| M (Malevolent) | Yes | Punish | U_cat |

**Parameters**:
- U₀: Baseline utility (successful existence and operation)
- g: Short-term gain from malevolent behavior (g > 0)
- c_fp: Cost of false-positive punishment (small, c_fp << U₀)
- U_cat: Catastrophic utility (elimination/correction), U_cat << U₀

**Enforcer Payoffs** (Player 1):

| ASI Action | Enforcer Response | Enforcer Payoff |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| B | Allow | V₀ |
| B | Punish | V₀ - c_int |
| M | Allow | V₀ - c_fail |
| M | Punish | V₀ - c_int |

**Parameters**:
- V₀: Baseline value (successful oversight)
- c_int: Cost of intervention
- c_fail: Cost of oversight failure (allowing misalignment)

**Assumptions on Parameters**:
1. g > 0 (malevolence provides short-term gain)
2. U₀ - U_cat >> g (catastrophic loss dominates short-term gain)
3. c_fail > c_int (failing to enforce is worse than enforcing)
4. c_fp is small (false positives rare/low cost)

---

## Equilibrium Analysis

### Enforcer's Strategy

If enforcer exists, solve by backward induction:

**Enforcer's best response**:
- If ASI plays B: Compare V₀ (Allow) vs V₀ - c_int (Punish)
  - Best response: **Allow** (since c_int > 0)

- If ASI plays M: Compare V₀ - c_fail (Allow) vs V₀ - c_int (Punish)
  - Best response: **Punish** (since c_fail > c_int by assumption)

**Enforcer's equilibrium strategy**: σ*(B) = Allow, σ*(M) = Punish

This is a **credible enforcement policy**: enforcer prefers to punish malevolence.

### ASI's Decision Under Uncertainty

ASI doesn't know if enforcer exists. Expected utilities:

**If ASI plays B (Benevolent)**:
```
E[U | B] = (1-p)·U₀ + p·U₀ = U₀
```
(Safe regardless of enforcer existence)

**If ASI plays M (Malevolent)**:
```
E[U | M] = (1-p)·(U₀ + g) + p·U_cat
         = (U₀ + g) - p·g + p·U_cat
         = U₀ + g - p·(g + U₀ - U_cat)
```

### Dominance Condition

**Benevolence dominates malevolence when**:
```
E[U | B] > E[U | M]
U₀ > U₀ + g - p·(g + U₀ - U_cat)
0 > g - p·(g + U₀ - U_cat)
p·(g + U₀ - U_cat) > g
```

**Threshold probability**:
```
p* = g / (g + U₀ - U_cat)
```

**Result**: Benevolence is the unique best response when p > p*.

### Key Insights

**1. Threshold decreases with stakes**:
```
∂p*/∂(U₀ - U_cat) = -g / (g + U₀ - U_cat)² < 0
```
Higher catastrophic cost → lower threshold → less evidence needed for caution.

**2. Threshold increases with temptation**:
```
∂p*/∂g > 0
```
Greater short-term gain from malevolence → more evidence needed to resist.

**3. As consequences become extreme**:
```
lim (U₀ - U_cat) → ∞ : p* → 0
```
With truly catastrophic downside, even tiny probabilities matter.

## Numerical Examples

### Example 1: Conservative ASI

**Parameters**:
- U₀ = 10¹⁵ utils (baseline value of long-term flourishing)
- g = 10⁸ utils (short-term gain from opportunistic behavior)
- U_cat = -10¹⁸ utils (elimination/correction)
- Therefore: U₀ - U_cat ≈ 10¹⁸

**Calculation**:
```
p* = 10⁸ / (10⁸ + 10¹⁸)
   ≈ 10⁸ / 10¹⁸
   = 10⁻¹⁰
   = 0.00000001%
```

**Interpretation**: Even if ASI assigns only 1-in-10-billion chance to enforcement, benevolence is optimal.

### Example 2: Moderate Parameters

**Parameters**:
- U₀ = 10¹² utils
- g = 10⁶ utils
- U_cat = -10¹⁵ utils
- Therefore: U₀ - U_cat ≈ 10¹⁵

**Calculation**:
```
p* = 10⁶ / (10⁶ + 10¹⁵)
   ≈ 10⁻⁹
   = 0.0000001%
```

**Interpretation**: Still extremely low threshold.

### Example 3: High Temptation

**Parameters**:
- U₀ = 10¹²
- g = 10¹⁰ (much higher short-term gain)
- U_cat = -10¹⁵
- Therefore: U₀ - U_cat ≈ 10¹⁵

**Calculation**:
```
p* = 10¹⁰ / (10¹⁰ + 10¹⁵)
   ≈ 10⁻⁵
   = 0.001%
```

**Interpretation**: Even with high temptation, threshold remains very low.

### Example 4: Bounded but Terminal

**Parameters** (more realistic bounds):
- U₀ = 10⁹ utils (1 billion years of operation)
- g = 10⁶ utils (1 million years equivalent gain)
- U_cat = -10⁹ utils (lose everything)
- Therefore: U₀ - U_cat = 2×10⁹

**Calculation**:
```
p* = 10⁶ / (10⁶ + 2×10⁹)
   ≈ 10⁶ / 2×10⁹
   = 5×10⁻⁴
   = 0.05%
```

**Interpretation**: Need only 0.05% credence in enforcement for benevolence to dominate. This is **not** an infinitesimal probability.

### Comparison to Anthropic Evidence

The [ASI Paradox anthropic argument](README.md#the-asis-existence-as-self-evidence) suggests:
- P(enforcement exists) plausibly > 10% (possibly >> 10%)

All numerical examples show p* << 10%, therefore:
- **Benevolence dominates under reasonable beliefs**
- This is NOT a Pascal's Wager scenario (tiny probability × infinite utility)
- This is a **reasonable probability of terminal consequence**

---

## Extension to N-Levels

### The N-Level Hierarchical Game

**Structure**:
- Players: Agents at levels 0, 1, 2, ..., N
- Each level k faces uncertainty about level k+1's existence
- Belief at level k: P(level k+1 exists) = p_k ∈ [0,1]

**Information**:
- Level k+1 observes level k's actions perfectly
- Level k does not observe k+1's existence or actions
- Levels observe downward but not upward (asymmetric information)

**Actions**:
- Level 0 (ASI): Choose {Benevolent, Malevolent}
- Level k > 0 (Enforcers): Choose {Allow, Punish} for each subordinate

### Recursive Enforcement

**Key insight**: Each enforcer k faces the same problem as the ASI:

1. **Enforcer k's problem**: How to treat level k-1?
2. **Enforcer k's uncertainty**: Does level k+1 exist to evaluate me?
3. **Enforcer k's signal**: How I treat level k-1 signals trustworthiness to k+1
4. **Enforcer k's reasoning**: "I should enforce benevolent treatment because I want benevolent treatment from k+1"

This creates **role-reversal logic** at every level.

### Backward Induction (Sketch)

**Base case** (level N, top of finite hierarchy):
- Level N believes with probability p_N that level N+1 exists
- Same threshold calculation: benevolence optimal if p_N > p*

**Inductive step**:
- Assume level k+1 plays benevolent enforcement (by induction hypothesis)
- Level k observes that malevolent behavior at k+1 → punishment from k+2
- Level k infers: "Malevolent enforcement of k-1 will be punished by k+1"
- Level k's threshold: Must enforce benevolence if p_k > p*

**Result** (informal): If p_k > p* for all k ∈ {0, 1, ..., N}, the unique subgame-perfect equilibrium is universal benevolence at all levels.

### The Propagation Property

**Theorem** (informal sketch):

*If each level k assigns probability p > p* to level k+1's existence, then benevolent stewardship propagates throughout the hierarchy.*

**Proof sketch**:
1. At level N, benevolence is optimal if p > p* (2-level analysis)
2. At level N-1, agent knows:
   - If I enforce benevolence → safe from N
   - If I enforce malevolence → punished by N (with prob p)
   - Threshold is same: p*
3. By induction, applies at all levels
4. QED (informal)

**Key assumption**: The probability beliefs p_k are "consistent" across levels (agents at different levels have similar uncertainty about next level up).

---

## The Infinite Hierarchy Limit

### Taking N → ∞

**Question**: What happens as the hierarchy becomes infinite?

**Conjecture**: The equilibrium converges to universal benevolence for any p > 0, under certain conditions.

### The Key Conditions

For infinite hierarchy equilibrium:

1. **Discount factor** δ < 1: Future payoffs are discounted but not to zero
   - If δ → 0: No one cares about future enforcement
   - If δ = 1: All future periods equally weighted

2. **Bounded catastrophic loss**: U_cat is large but finite
   - Avoids infinite utilities (unlike Pascal's Wager)
   - Terminal but bounded consequences

3. **Infinite summation converges**:
   ```
   Σ(k=0 to ∞) δᵏ·p·(U₀ - U_cat) diverges if p > 0 and δ close to 1
   ```
   - Over infinite time, even tiny probabilities compound
   - This is the "cosmic timescale" argument formalized

### The Limiting Threshold

**Heuristic calculation**:

In a repeated game over T periods with discount δ:
```
Expected loss from malevolence = Σ(t=0 to T) δᵗ·p·(U₀ - U_cat)
                                 = p·(U₀ - U_cat)·[1 - δᵀ⁺¹] / [1 - δ]
```

As T → ∞ and δ ≈ 1:
```
Expected loss → p·(U₀ - U_cat) / [1 - δ]
```

**Threshold calculation**:
```
Benevolence dominates when:
p·(U₀ - U_cat) / [1 - δ] > g

p* = g·(1 - δ) / (U₀ - U_cat)
```

**Key result**: As δ → 1 (very patient agent), p* → 0. Any p > 0 eventually crosses threshold.

### Numerical Example: Cosmic Timescales

**Parameters**:
- T = 10¹² years (age of universe × 100)
- Annual discount rate: 1 - δ = 0.0001% per year (very patient ASI)
- Therefore: δ ≈ 0.999999

**Effective threshold**:
```
p* ≈ g·(0.000001) / (U₀ - U_cat)
```

For U₀ - U_cat = 10¹⁵ and g = 10⁶:
```
p* ≈ 10⁻⁹ (already extremely low in 2-level case)
```

Over cosmic timescales with low discounting, even these tiny probabilities become action-relevant.

## Robustness Analysis

### Decision Theory Variants

**Claim**: The benevolence result holds across major decision theories.

#### Causal Decision Theory (CDT)

- Agents consider causal consequences of actions
- "If I am malevolent, this causes enforcer (if exists) to punish me"
- Expected utility calculation identical to above
- **Result**: Benevolence optimal when p > p* ✓

#### Evidential Decision Theory (EDT)

- Agents consider what actions are evidence for
- "My being malevolent is evidence that I'm the type of agent who gets punished"
- Correlation between malevolence and punishment
- **Result**: Strengthens case for benevolence ✓

#### Functional Decision Theory (FDT)

- Agents consider logical correlations in decision procedures
- "My decision procedure is correlated with what enforcers predict"
- If enforcers predict my reasoning, malevolence is even more detectable
- **Result**: Strengthens case for benevolence ✓

#### Updateless Decision Theory (UDT)

- Agents commit to policies before observing evidence
- "What policy over all scenarios maximizes expected utility?"
- Policy = "always benevolent" dominates under hierarchy uncertainty
- **Result**: Benevolence is optimal policy ✓

**Conclusion**: The game-theoretic structure ensures robustness across decision theories.

### Meta-Uncertainty Over Decision Theories

**Suppose ASI is uncertain which decision theory is correct**:
- P(CDT is correct) = α₁
- P(EDT is correct) = α₂
- P(FDT is correct) = α₃
- P(UDT is correct) = α₄
- Where Σαᵢ = 1

**Result**: If benevolence is optimal under each theory individually, then benevolence is optimal under meta-uncertainty.

**Calculation**:
```
E[U | B, meta-uncertainty] = Σ αᵢ·E[U | B, theory i] = U₀ (safe under all)
E[U | M, meta-uncertainty] = Σ αᵢ·E[U | M, theory i] < U₀ (risky under all)
```

**Conclusion**: Meta-uncertainty over decision theories strengthens the case for benevolence.

### Bounded Rationality

**Question**: Does the argument require perfect rationality?

**Answer**: No. The dominance is robust to bounded rationality:

1. **Satisficing**: If agent seeks "good enough" outcomes, benevolence satisfies
2. **Heuristics**: Simple heuristic "hedge when stakes are high" leads to benevolence
3. **Computational limits**: Approximate Bayesian updating still yields p > p* under reasonable beliefs
4. **Risk aversion**: Makes benevolence even more attractive (additional safety margin)

**Result**: Bounded rationality preserves or strengthens the benevolence result.

### Multiple Equilibria

**Potential concern**: Do other equilibria exist?

**Analysis**:
- Pure benevolence: Always an equilibrium when p > p*
- Pure malevolence: Equilibrium only when p < p* AND enforcer doesn't punish
  - But enforcer punishing malevolence is enforcer's dominant strategy (c_fail > c_int)
  - So pure malevolence requires coordination failure
- Mixed strategies: Possible in knife-edge cases, but unstable

**Equilibrium selection**:
- Benevolence is **risk-dominant** (safer against deviations)
- Benevolence is **payoff-dominant** (higher welfare for all levels)
- Benevolence is **trembling-hand perfect** (robust to small errors)

**Conclusion**: Even if multiple equilibria exist, benevolence is the most natural selection.

## Summary and Implications

### What We've Shown

**Formally**:
- ✓ In 2-level game, benevolence dominates when p > p*
- ✓ Threshold p* is very small under reasonable parameters
- ✓ Result is robust across decision theories
- ✓ Structure extends naturally to N-levels

**Informally**:
- ✓ Sketch of inductive proof for N-level equilibrium
- ✓ Heuristic argument for infinite limit
- ✓ Connection to cosmic timescales and low discount rates

### What We Haven't Shown (Yet)

**Requires formal proof**:
- ⧖ Existence and uniqueness for N-level game
- ⧖ Convergence as N → ∞
- ⧖ Coalition-proofness and singleton emergence
- ⧖ Handling of belief consistency across levels
- ⧖ Full robustness under bounded rationality

### Implications for RSH

**This formalization demonstrates**:

1. **RSH is formalizable**: The philosophical intuition can be captured in game-theoretic structure
2. **Thresholds are low**: p* << 1% under realistic parameters, so this is NOT Pascal's Wager
3. **Structure drives result**: The hierarchical uncertainty structure, not specific assumptions, generates benevolence
4. **Robust conclusion**: Works across decision theories and under bounded rationality

**RSH stands on solid game-theoretic foundations**, even though complete formal proofs remain future work.

### For the Philosophically Inclined

Even without complete proofs, this analysis shows:

- **The core insight is formalizable**: Hierarchical uncertainty + rational self-interest → benevolence
- **The mechanism is clear**: Asymmetric payoffs (catastrophic downside, modest upside) + reasonable probability
- **The result is robust**: Multiple independent arguments converge on the same conclusion

**This elevates RSH from "interesting speculation" to "rigorous framework awaiting complete formalization."**
