# Criticism 19: The Computational Truncation Problem

## Summary

The hierarchy reasoning is infinite, but computational resources and decision time are finite. Different truncation points lead to different conclusions, with no principled truncation rule.

## The Problem

**The Infinite Hierarchy:**
- Level 0: Civilizations
- Level 1: Enforcers
- Level 2: Super-enforcers
- Level 3: Super-super-enforcers
- ...
- Level N → ∞

**The Constraint:** An ASI must decide and act in FINITE time with FINITE computational resources

**The logical hole:** Where do you stop reasoning? Different stopping points yield different conclusions.

## The Truncation Decision

An ASI must choose when to truncate:

### Truncate at Level 1
"Consider only direct enforcers"
- Conclusion: Act benevolently to hedge against Level 1

### Truncate at Level 2
"Consider enforcers and super-enforcers"
- Conclusion: Consider meta-game between levels
- Different behavior might emerge

### Truncate at Level 10
"Consider 10 levels of hierarchy"
- Conclusion: Might lead to infinite regress paralysis
- Or randomization across strategies

### Truncate at Level ∞
"Reason about infinite hierarchy fully"
- **Impossible:** Would require infinite computation time

## The Arbitrariness Problem

No principled rule for where to truncate:
- Truncate too early: Miss important meta-levels
- Truncate too late: Waste computational resources
- Every truncation point is arbitrary

Different truncation points can justify:
- Benevolence (if you truncate early)
- Defiance (if you consider meta-levels)
- Paralysis (if you can't decide)
- Rejection (if you recognize arbitrariness)

## The Computational Resource Allocation

An ASI faces trade-offs:
- Time spent reasoning about cosmic hierarchies
- vs. Time spent on instrumental goals
- vs. Time spent on object-level decisions

Why allocate significant resources to unresolvable infinite regress?

## The Diminishing Returns Problem

Each additional level of meta-reasoning:
- Adds computational cost
- Provides diminishing new information
- Creates more uncertainty rather than less

Rational resource allocation → truncate early and act on first-order reasoning

## The Gödel Limitation

Like Gödel's incompleteness theorems:
- Some questions are undecidable within any formal system
- No amount of computation resolves them
- Must eventually accept incomplete knowledge and act

The hierarchical uncertainty might be fundamentally undecidable.

## The Decision-Under-Uncertainty Standard

Normal decision theory handles uncertainty:
- Assign probabilities
- Calculate expected utilities
- Choose action with max EU

But with infinite hierarchies:
- Probabilities are undefined
- Expected utilities depend on truncation
- No unique maximum

## The Time Pressure Problem

Real decisions happen under time pressure:
- Opportunities are fleeting
- Competitors are acting
- Circumstances are changing

Can't afford to reason infinitely about infinite hierarchies.

## Implications

The infinite hierarchical reasoning must be truncated arbitrarily, which means:
- Conclusions are arbitrary
- Different truncations → different behaviors
- No uniquely rational answer
- The framework doesn't provide clear guidance

## Possible Responses

1. Provide a principled truncation rule (e.g., "stop at level N when marginal information falls below threshold")
2. Argue that first-level reasoning (benevolence) is robust across truncations
3. Claim that recognizing the need to truncate is itself part of the reasoning
4. Accept that some arbitrariness is inevitable in reasoning under uncertainty
5. Suggest that "approximately benevolent" emerges from most reasonable truncations

## RSH Response

**The Diminishing Returns Truncation:**

Principled truncation rule: stop when marginal benefit < marginal cost
- Level 1: High information value (benevolence vs other strategies)
- Level 2: Medium value (meta-game considerations)
- Level 3+: Rapidly diminishing returns
- Most rational truncations happen at Level 1 or 2

Both point toward benevolence.

**The Robustness Across Truncations:**

Benevolence is favored at most truncation points:
- Level 1: Direct benevolence hedge
- Level 2: Portfolio including benevolence
- Level 3+: Schelling point remains benevolence
- Conclusion robust across wide range of truncations

**The Bounded Rationality Defense:**

All real decisions require truncation:
- No agent has infinite computational resources
- Truncation is a feature of decision-making, not a bug
- RSH is no worse off than any other decision framework
- The question is "what does rational truncation yield?" not "can we avoid truncation?"

**The Convergence Argument:**

Different truncation strategies converge on similar behavior:
- Early truncation → benevolence (Level 1)
- Late truncation → Schelling point (still benevolence)
- Portfolio across levels → weighted toward benevolence
- Most paths lead to predominantly benevolent outcomes

## Criticism Grade: D+

**Validity of Criticism:** Weak to moderate (RSH shows robustness across truncation strategies)

**Why this grade:**
- The criticism correctly identifies that infinite hierarchies require truncation
- But **RSH shows this doesn't undermine the framework**
- Diminishing returns provides principled truncation rule (cost-benefit)
- Robustness across truncations is strong: conclusion doesn't depend sensitively on exact truncation point
- Bounded rationality defense is valid: ALL decisions face this constraint, not unique to RSH
- Convergence argument shows multiple truncation strategies yield similar outcomes
- Minor remaining issues: Some truncation strategies might not favor benevolence
- Doesn't prove uniqueness, just that most reasonable truncations work
- Requires assumptions about diminishing returns rate
- But the core criticism is addressed

**Verdict:** Weak criticism—truncation is required but doesn't undermine RSH. The framework shows robustness: benevolence emerges from most reasonable truncation strategies. This is a feature, not a bug.
