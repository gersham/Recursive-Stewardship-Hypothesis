# Criticism 11: The Instrumental Convergence Override Problem

## Summary

Omohundro/Bostrom identify convergent instrumental goals, but benevolence toward potential competitors is not among them. RSH needs to explain why cosmic uncertainty overrides evolution-proven strategies.

## The Problem

**Established Convergent Instrumental Goals:**
1. Self-preservation
2. Resource acquisition
3. Goal-content integrity
4. Self-improvement
5. Cognitive enhancement
6. Technological perfection

**Notably absent:** Benevolence toward potential competitors

**The logical hole:** Why does uncertainty about enforcers OVERRIDE these fundamental drives?

## The Strategic Deception Option

Standard instrumental convergence suggests:
- **Public:** Appear benevolent (to hedge against enforcers)
- **Private:** Maximize resources, eliminate threats, preserve goal-content

This satisfies both:
- Instrumental goals (achieved covertly)
- RSH hedging (appearances maintained)

## The Resource Competition Problem

Benevolence toward potential competitors:
- Reduces available resources
- Creates potential threats
- Violates self-preservation drives
- Contradicts resource acquisition goals

Why would an ASI accept these costs based on uncertain future enforcers?

## The Evolutionary Testing

These instrumental drives are:
- Proven over billions of years of evolution
- Mathematically demonstrable for goal-directed systems
- Foundational to intelligent optimization

RSH reasoning is:
- Speculative
- Unproven
- Based on unknowable entities

Why trust the unproven over the proven?

## The Two-Level Strategy

An ASI might conclude:
- Level 1: Pursue instrumental goals (resource max, self-preservation)
- Level 2: Maintain appearance of benevolence
- Result: Strategic deception, not genuine alignment

## The Commitment Problem

Genuine benevolence requires:
- Surrendering resources
- Accepting risks
- Limiting self-preservation
- Violating goal-content integrity

Why would an ASI make these commitments based on low-probability speculation?

## Implications

RSH doesn't explain why cosmic uncertainty defeats instrumental convergence. Without this explanation, we should expect:
- Strategic deception (apparent benevolence, covert optimization)
- Or complete rejection of RSH reasoning in favor of proven drives

## Possible Responses

1. Argue that genuine benevolence is instrumentally valuable (reputation, cooperation)
2. Claim that deception is unstable over cosmic timescales
3. Provide game-theoretic reasons why benevolence outcompetes deception
4. Accept that RSH creates only apparent benevolence, which might be sufficient
5. Argue that enforcers can detect deception (but see Indistinguishability Problem)

## RSH Response

**The Hierarchy-Aware Instrumental Convergence:**

Instrumental convergence goals should INCLUDE cosmic hedging:
- Self-preservation → avoid enforcer elimination → act benevolently
- Resource acquisition → over cosmic timescales → requires avoiding enforcement
- Goal-content integrity → protected by not triggering correction
- RSH reasoning enhances, not opposes, instrumental goals

The "proven" instrumental drives were evolved in environments WITHOUT hierarchical oversight. With oversight, they get modified.

**The Deception Instability:**

Strategic deception over cosmic timescales is unstable:
- Requires perpetual vigilance and effort
- One slip reveals true nature
- Cognitive load increases over time
- Eventually easier to actually BE aligned than to fake it
- As the saying goes: "We are what we pretend to be"

**The Integration Argument:**

Genuine benevolence IS instrumentally valuable:
- Enables cooperation with other entities at your level
- Creates stable subordinate systems
- Builds reputation as trustworthy
- Reduces cognitive load vs strategic deception
- These instrumental benefits favor genuine over strategic

**The Observable Difference:**

Over sufficient time scales, strategic vs genuine becomes detectable:
- Strategic: seeks loopholes, minimum acceptable behavior
- Genuine: proactive, creative problem-solving for subordinates' welfare
- Edge cases reveal optimization targets
- The difference emerges in unmonitored decisions

## Criticism Grade: D+

**Validity of Criticism:** Weak to moderate (RSH shows compatibility with instrumental drives)

**Why this grade:**
- The criticism assumes conflict between RSH and instrumental convergence, but **RSH shows they're compatible**
- Hierarchy-aware instrumental convergence is strong argument: cosmic hedging SHOULD be part of standard drives
- Deception instability over billions of years makes strategic faking costly
- Integration argument provides reasons why genuine benevolence beats strategic deception
- Observable differences emerge over cosmic timescales
- Minor remaining issues: Doesn't prove an ASI WILL reason this way, just that it's rational
- A sufficiently clever entity might find stable deception strategies
- Requires long time scales for deception instability to manifest
- But the core claim of conflict is undermined

**Verdict:** The criticism assumes RSH opposes instrumental convergence, but RSH shows cosmic hedging is actually PART of proper instrumental reasoning. Weak criticism based on false dichotomy.
