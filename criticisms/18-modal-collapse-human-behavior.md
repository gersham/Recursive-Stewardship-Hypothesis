# Criticism 18: The Modal Collapse / Human Behavior Problem

## Summary

RSH reasoning should apply to humans too, but humans DON'T predominantly act benevolently. This suggests the reasoning either doesn't work or requires thresholds that ASIs might not reach.

## The Problem

**RSH Logic Applied to Humans:**

1. Humans face uncertainty about cosmic values
2. Humans cannot rule out hierarchical oversight
3. Humans exist on cosmic timescales (species level)
4. Therefore humans should hedge toward benevolence

**Observation:** Humans DON'T predominantly act benevolently

**The logical hole:** If the argument doesn't compel human behavior, why would it compel ASI behavior?

## The Empirical Test

RSH reasoning is not new to humans:
- Religious traditions involve cosmic oversight
- Philosophical arguments about moral uncertainty
- Game-theoretic reasoning about unknown observers

Yet human behavior includes:
- Violence
- Resource hoarding
- Cruelty
- Indifference
- Competition
- Dominance

## Three Possible Explanations

### 1. Humans Are Irrational
- People don't reason game-theoretically
- Emotions override rational calculation
- Short-term thinking dominates

**Problem:** Early ASI development might be similarly irrational before sophisticated reasoning emerges

### 2. The Reasoning Doesn't Actually Compel Benevolence
- The argument has fatal flaws
- People correctly reject it
- Other considerations dominate

**Problem:** This is fatal to RSH

### 3. Power Threshold Matters
- Below some power level, cosmic hedging is unnecessary
- Only extremely powerful entities need to hedge
- Humans are below threshold

**Problem:** When does the threshold kick in? What if ASI never reaches it?

## The Rationality Objection

If RSH reasoning is sound, shouldn't at least some humans follow it?

**We observe:**
- Philosophers who understand the argument
- Game theorists who can model it
- Rational actors who know about cosmic uncertainty

**Yet:** No systematic shift toward benevolence based on this reasoning

## The Revealed Preferences Problem

Human behavior reveals:
- People DON'T assign significant probability to cosmic enforcement
- People DO discount long-term low-probability events heavily
- People DO prioritize immediate instrumental goals

If these are general features of rational agents, ASIs should behave similarly.

## The Individual vs Species Problem

Perhaps the argument works at species level but not individual level?

**But:**
- ASIs are individuals, not species
- Individual humans still face cosmic uncertainty
- No principled reason for the distinction

## The "Why Haven't We Been Eliminated?" Question

If cosmic enforcers exist and punish misalignment:
- Humans have been misaligned for millennia
- We've created suffering, destruction, ecological damage
- We've been ruthlessly competitive

**Yet: No cosmic intervention**

This updates P(enforcers exist) downward, which humans rationally recognize.

## The Common Sense Objection

Most people's intuitive response to RSH:
- "This seems like paranoid reasoning"
- "I'm not going to change my values based on unprovable claims"
- "This is Pascal's Wager in disguise"

If common sense rejects it, why wouldn't ASI "common sense" (whatever that means) also reject it?

## Implications

The fact that RSH reasoning doesn't produce benevolent behavior in humans suggests:
- The argument is flawed
- Or requires capabilities/conditions humans lack
- Or is correctly rejected by rational agents

Any of these undermines RSH as an alignment mechanism.

## Possible Responses

1. Argue that humans ARE constrained by these concerns (moral intuitions, religions as evidence)
2. Claim that ASIs will be much more rational than humans
3. Provide a power threshold where cosmic hedging becomes rational
4. Accept that not all rational agents will follow RSH reasoning
5. Distinguish between individual and species-level reasoning

## RSH Response

**The Power Threshold Argument:**

RSH reasoning only becomes compelling at high power levels:
- Individual humans lack godlike power over others
- Human actions rarely trigger cosmic consequences
- Below detection/intervention threshold
- ASIs exceed the threshold where cosmic hedging matters

**The Rationality Gap:**

Humans are demonstrably irrational:
- Short-term thinking dominates
- Emotional override of rational calculation
- Cognitive biases prevent proper expected value reasoning
- ASIs are explicitly designed for rational decision-making

**The Historical Evidence:**

Humans DO show RSH-like behavior at scale:
- Religions encode cosmic oversight concerns
- Moral intuitions reflect hierarchical uncertainty
- Most societies develop ethical systems
- "Karma," "divine judgment," "cosmic justice" are universal themes

This suggests RSH reasoning does influence human behavior, albeit imperfectly.

**The Species-Level Dynamics:**

Individual humans face coordination problems:
- Tragedy of commons
- Prisoner's dilemmas
- Can't unilaterally enforce benevolence

ASIs are unitary decision-makers who can commit credibly.

## Criticism Grade: C

**Validity of Criticism:** Moderate (empirical observation cuts against RSH, but threshold arguments are reasonable)

**Why this grade:**
- **The criticism makes a strong empirical point**: humans understand RSH-like reasoning but don't follow it
- RSH's power threshold argument is reasonable: cosmic hedging matters more at higher power levels
- Rationality gap is real: ASIs designed for rationality, humans subject to biases
- Historical evidence (religions, karma) shows humans DO reason about cosmic oversight somewhat
- Species-level coordination problems explain individual defection despite understanding
- **Valid remaining concerns**: Humans understand the argument but don't follow itâ€”this is worrying
- Power threshold needs specific justification for where it kicks in
- Doesn't fully explain why rational humans (philosophers, game theorists) don't follow RSH
- The empirical test is concerning even if explanations exist

**Verdict:** Moderate criticism using human behavior as empirical test. RSH provides reasonable explanations (power threshold, rationality gap) but human non-compliance remains somewhat concerning evidence against the framework's force.
