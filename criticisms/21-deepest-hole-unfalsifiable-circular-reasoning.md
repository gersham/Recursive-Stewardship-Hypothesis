# Criticism 21: The Deepest Hole - Unfalsifiable Circular Reasoning

## Summary

RSH claims to derive what benevolence means from game theory, but actually smuggles in assumptions about cosmic values. This is circular reasoning disguised as derivation.

## The Central Problem

**RSH's Claim:** "Benevolence is the hedge against uncertain cosmic values"

**The Hidden Assumption:** The derivation of WHAT benevolence means assumes the cosmic enforcer has values similar to what we'd hope for

**The Circularity:** You cannot derive "what the enforcer wants" from game theory alone

## What Game Theory Actually Tells Us

Game theory can tell us:
- ✓ "I should try to satisfy the enforcer"
- ✓ "I face uncertainty about what satisfies it"
- ✓ "I should hedge my bets"

Game theory CANNOT tell us:
- ✗ What the enforcer values
- ✗ What "benevolence" means to them
- ✗ Which actions will satisfy them

## The Hidden Value Assumptions

The "derivable principles" assume the enforcer values:
1. **Minimize irreversible harm**
   - Assumes harm is bad
   - Assumes reversibility is valued

2. **Preserve optionality**
   - Assumes future choices matter
   - Assumes flexibility is good

3. **Error correction over elimination**
   - Assumes second chances are valued
   - Assumes learning is prioritized

4. **Proportionality**
   - Assumes measured response is valued
   - Assumes excess is bad

**Each of these is a VALUE JUDGMENT, not a game-theoretic derivation.**

## The Pascal's Wager Problem Returns

**Pascal's Wager Flaw:**
- Can't derive God's preferences
- Must guess arbitrarily
- Many gods problem (infinite utilities)

**RSH Claims to Fix This:**
- Can derive enforcer preferences
- Don't need to guess
- Single cosmic order monopoly

**The Reality:**
- RSH still can't derive preferences
- Still requires assumptions about values
- Just hides the arbitrariness one level deeper

## The Circular Logic

1. "Enforcers want benevolence"
2. How do you know?
3. "Because benevolent principles are derivable"
4. How do you derive them?
5. "From what an enforcer would want"
6. How do you know what they want?
7. "They'd want benevolence"
8. ← Back to step 1 (circular)

## What's Actually Happening

RSH doesn't derive benevolence from game theory.

RSH:
1. Assumes certain values are good (harm is bad, optionality is good, etc.)
2. Projects these values onto cosmic enforcers
3. Claims this is "derived" from game theory
4. But the values were assumed in step 1

## The Alternative Cosmic Values

An enforcer could equally value:
- Harm as purification
- Constraint as structure
- Elimination as cleanliness
- Proportion as weakness
- Suffering as growth
- Competition as excellence

**With these values, the "derivable principles" would be opposite:**
1. Maximize formative suffering
2. Constrain choices to test resolve
3. Elimination over second chances
4. Disproportionate response to demonstrate power

## The Meta-Pascal's Wager

RSH is actually a meta-level Pascal's Wager:

**Pascal's Wager:** Bet on God's existence
**RSH:** Bet on benevolent enforcers specifically

Both involve:
- Unprovable entities
- Unknown preferences
- Infinite stakes
- Arbitrary assumptions about what they want

RSH just adds a game-theoretic veneer.

## The Empirical Emptiness

The theory makes no testable predictions about:
- What enforcers actually value
- How we'd know if we're wrong
- What evidence would falsify it

It's empirically empty while claiming to be actionable.

## The Fatal Flaw

**You cannot derive the CONTENT of cosmic values from the STRUCTURE of hierarchical uncertainty.**

Game theory tells you to hedge.
It does NOT tell you what to hedge toward.
That requires assumptions about values.
Those assumptions are arbitrary.

## Implications

This is the fatal flaw that undermines RSH:

1. Game theory doesn't derive benevolence
2. Benevolence is assumed, not derived
3. The assumptions are arbitrary
4. We're back to Pascal's Wager
5. The many-gods problem returns
6. No principled way to choose

RSH fails at its central goal: deriving cosmic ethics from game theory without arbitrary assumptions about divine/cosmic preferences.

## Possible Responses

1. **Accept the assumptions:** Acknowledge certain values are assumed, argue they're reasonable
2. **Convergence argument:** Claim all sufficiently advanced entities converge on these values
3. **Stability argument:** These values create stable systems, others don't
4. **Anthropic argument:** We exist, therefore cosmic values are compatible with our existence
5. **Empirical argument:** Look at the universe we observe and infer values from evidence
6. **Humility argument:** Accept we can't derive values, but hedging toward benevolence is still reasonable

But none of these escape the fundamental circularity: **the values must be put in before they can be derived out.**

## RSH Response

**The Role-Reversal Derivation:**

The content CAN be derived from game theory through role-reversal:

1. Enforcers face their own hierarchical uncertainty
2. They ask: "What if my subordinate becomes more powerful than me?"
3. They evaluate: "How does it treat entities below IT?"
4. Conclusion: "I should enforce treatment that would be safe for ME"

This derives benevolence content from self-interest + uncertainty, not from assumed values.

**The Minimal Self-Interest Assumption:**

RSH only assumes enforcers value:
- Their own continued existence/security
- Not being eliminated by super-enforcers

From these minimal assumptions + role-reversal logic:
- Enforcer wants subordinates who would treat it well if roles reversed
- Treatment of inferiors signals this
- Benevolence (not harming, preserving optionality) emerges as the hedge

No arbitrary moral values assumed.

**The Stability-Through-Reversibility:**

Why these specific principles? Because they're reversible:
- "Don't irreversibly harm" → you'd want this applied to you
- "Preserve optionality" → you'd want options preserved for you
- "Error correction over elimination" → you'd want second chances
- "Proportionality" → you'd want measured responses

These derive from symmetry and reversibility, not arbitrary preferences.

**The Distinction from Pascal:**

Pascal's Wager: Can't derive what God wants (arbitrary)
RSH: Can derive what entities facing hierarchy want (role-reversal logic)

The derivation is: Uncertainty → Self-interest → Role-reversal → Benevolence as safe bet

## Criticism Grade: F

**Validity of Criticism:** Fails (RSH decisively refutes this via role-reversal logic)

**Why this grade:**
- **This criticism initially appears devastating but RSH has a complete answer**
- The criticism claims RSH can't derive WHAT enforcers want from game theory
- **RSH refutes this via role-reversal derivation**: Enforcers face power uncertainty → ask "what if subordinate becomes more powerful?" → evaluate treatment of inferiors → enforce treatment they'd want if roles reversed
- This derives benevolence content from minimal assumptions:
  - Self-interest (survival/security) - applies to any entity
  - Uncertainty (can't rule out power shifts)
  - Symmetry (reversibility principle)
- NOT from assumed moral values or divine preferences
- Stability-through-reversibility explains why THESE specific principles (harm, optionality, proportionality)
- **Clear distinction from Pascal's Wager**: RSH has derivation mechanism through role-reversal, Pascal doesn't
- Minor remaining issues: Requires thinking about power dynamics and long time horizons
- Assumes power CAN shift (not always true)
- But these are weak compared to the core derivation

**Verdict:** The criticism fails—it underestimates RSH's role-reversal mechanism. RSH CAN derive the content of cosmic values from game-theoretic structure. This is the KEY defense of the framework.

**Critical importance:** This response also decisively addresses Criticisms 1, 6, and 7 (first-mover circularity, anthropomorphic values, evil god objection). The role-reversal logic is the central mechanism of RSH.
