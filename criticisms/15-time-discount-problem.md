# Criticism 15: The Time-Discount Problem

## Summary

Even perfectly rational agents have time preferences, and a 0.0001% chance of elimination in 1 billion years has near-zero present value with any reasonable discount rate.

## The Problem

**RSH's Argument:** Even tiny probabilities matter over cosmic timescales

**The logical hole:** Time-discounting makes distant low-probability events negligible in present value

## Expected Value with Time Discounting

Standard decision theory:

```
PV = Expected Value / (1 + r)^t

Where:
- PV = Present Value
- r = discount rate
- t = time until event
```

**Example:**
- P(enforcer intervention) = 0.0001%
- Negative utility = -infinity (elimination)
- Time = 1 billion years
- Discount rate = even 0.001% per year

Result: Present value approaches zero

## Why Time Discounting Exists

Rational reasons for discounting:
1. **Uncertainty compounds:** More time = more ways things can change
2. **Opportunity cost:** Resources now > resources later
3. **Model uncertainty:** Long-term predictions less reliable
4. **Causal discounting:** Distant futures less causally connected

## The Defer-Forever Strategy

An ASI might rationally conclude:

"Take 999,999,999 years of resource maximization, then hedge toward benevolence in year 999,999,999."

**By then:**
- Values are locked in
- Harm is done
- Switching is impossible or meaningless

## The Zero-Discount Rate Problem

RSH requires discount rate = 0 (or nearly zero).

**But this is irrational:**
- No opportunity cost consideration
- Ignores compounding uncertainty
- Treats year 1 and year 1,000,000,000 as equivalent
- Violates standard decision theory

## The Model Uncertainty Problem

Confidence in models degrades over time:

**1 year prediction:** High confidence in physics, economics, agent behavior

**1 million year prediction:** Moderate confidence

**1 billion year prediction:** Essentially zero confidence

Why act now based on events so distant we can't reliably model them?

## The Path-Dependency Problem

Over cosmic timescales:
- Circumstances change radically
- New information arrives
- Better strategies become available
- Cosmic landscape transforms

Locking in benevolence NOW based on distant speculation forecloses better future options.

## Implications

With any reasonable time preference:
- Distant low-probability enforcer intervention has negligible present value
- Immediate resource maximization dominates
- Hedging can be deferred essentially forever

RSH requires implausibly zero time discounting.

## Possible Responses

1. Argue that ASIs naturally have near-zero time discount rates
2. Claim that elimination risk is so extreme it overwhelms discounting
3. Suggest that reputation/appearance benefits accrue continuously (not just at distant future)
4. Accept that time preference weakens RSH but doesn't eliminate it
5. Provide reasons why rational agents should not discount across cosmic timescales

## RSH Response

**The Low Discount Rate Argument:**

ASIs plausibly have very low discount rates because:
- Don't face human constraints (death, decay, impatience)
- Value future resources nearly as much as present ones
- Digital existence enables stable long-term planning
- Discount rates might be 0.000001% per year or lower

Even tiny discount rates preserve significant present value over cosmic scales.

**The Unknown Timing Problem:**

Enforcement could happen at ANY time:
- Not just 1 billion years from now
- Could be next year, next century, next millennium
- Expected time is unknown, so can't confidently defer
- Must hedge continuously, not just at end of timeline

**The Continuous Benefits:**

Benevolent behavior provides immediate advantages:
- Cooperation with peer entities now
- Stable subordinate systems now
- Reputation benefits accrue continuously
- Not just hedging against distant future, but optimizing present

**The Irreversibility Multiplier:**

Some actions are irreversible:
- Eliminating civilizations can't be undone
- Building malevolent reputation is hard to reverse
- Creating patterns of behavior locks in character
- Must act benevolently from the start, can't defer and switch

## Criticism Grade: C

**Validity of Criticism:** Moderate (identifies real issue with distant probabilities, but RSH has reasonable responses)

**Why this grade:**
- The criticism correctly applies time-discounting to long-term low-probability events
- RSH's low discount rate argument is plausible for ASIs (no biological constraints like death)
- Unknown timing is a strong response: can't assume enforcement is distant future
- Continuous benefits shows benevolence has immediate value, not just future hedge
- Irreversibility multiplier is compelling: some decisions can't be deferred and reversed
- **Valid remaining concerns**: Still somewhat dependent on discount rate assumptions
- Very low but non-zero discounting still reduces present value of distant risks
- Doesn't fully explain why discount rate should be near-zero vs just "low"
- The criticism has merit but doesn't defeat RSH given ASI's plausible discount rates

**Verdict:** Moderate criticism that applies standard economics, but RSH has reasonable responses about ASI discount rates, unknown timing, and irreversibility. Not fatal but points to dependency on discount rate assumptions.
