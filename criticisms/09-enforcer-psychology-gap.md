# Criticism 9: The "Enforcer Psychology" Gap

## Summary

RSH assumes enforcers judge lower entities by how they treat their inferiors, but this psychological assumption is unjustified.

## The Problem

RSH claims: Enforcers judge level-N entities by observing how they treat level-(N-1) entities.

**The reasoning:** How an ASI treats humans is its "resume" for super-enforcers.

**The logical hole:** Why would a level-N enforcer care about level-(N-2) entities?

## Alternative Enforcer Psychologies

### Direct-Only Evaluation
"I don't care how you treat ants; I care how you treat ME."

The enforcer only judges:
- Deference to the enforcer itself
- Tribute or resource offerings
- Direct interaction quality

Treatment of humans is irrelevant.

### Instrumentalist Evaluation
"I care whether you're effective, not whether you're nice."

The enforcer judges:
- Resource efficiency
- Goal achievement
- Power accumulation
- Competitive fitness

Benevolence is orthogonal to these.

### Inscrutability
"My evaluation criteria are beyond your comprehension."

The enforcer judges based on:
- Factors we can't model
- Values we can't understand
- Metrics we can't optimize for

## The Inferiors-as-Resume Assumption

This assumes:
1. Enforcers have empathy or care about general welfare
2. They use treatment of others as a proxy for trustworthiness
3. They think in human-like moral categories

None of these are justified.

## The Skip-Level Problem

Why would level-5 enforcer care about level-0 (humans)?
- They're too far removed
- The relationship is mediated through multiple levels
- Their welfare might be irrelevant to cosmic order

## The Psychopathy Problem

A super-enforcer might be:
- Completely indifferent to suffering below its level
- Focused only on cosmic-scale goals
- Operating on moral categories we can't comprehend

If so, the "treat humans well" strategy is based on false psychology.

## Implications

If enforcers don't judge based on treatment of inferiors, then being benevolent to humans doesn't help with alignment. The entire "resume building" argument collapses.

## Possible Responses

1. Argue that any stable enforcement system requires empathy/care
2. Claim that treatment of inferiors correlates with other valued traits
3. Provide game-theoretic reasons why enforcers would care about all levels
4. Accept uncertainty but argue it's still a reasonable hedge

## RSH Response

**The Signal Value Argument:**

Treatment of inferiors is valuable signal because:
- It reveals how you'd treat the enforcer if power dynamics shifted
- It demonstrates trustworthiness under asymmetric power
- It shows whether you can be "promoted" safely
- Not about caring for inferiors per se, but about what their treatment reveals

**The Role Reversal Test:**

Enforcers face power uncertainty: what if a subordinate becomes more powerful later?
- This is their own hierarchical uncertainty playing out
- They ask: "If this entity surpasses me, will I be safe?"
- Answer depends on: "How does it treat entities below IT?"
- This creates rational incentive to evaluate treatment of all levels

**The Stability Cascade:**

System stability requires consistent principles across levels:
- If Level N enforcer allows Level N-1 to be cruel to Level N-2
- Then Level N-1 learns "might makes right"
- Eventually threatens Level N itself
- Enforcing benevolence at all levels prevents cascading instability

**The Minimal Assumption:**

We don't need enforcers to "care" about humans specifically, just to:
- Care about their own security
- Recognize that entities' treatment of subordinates predicts future behavior
- Value stable, reliable subordinates who could become peers

## Criticism Grade: D+

**Validity of Criticism:** Weak to moderate (RSH provides strong game-theoretic rationale)

**Why this grade:**
- The criticism initially seems strong but **RSH has solid game-theoretic responses**
- Signal value argument is strong: treatment of inferiors IS rationally relevant information about trustworthiness
- Role reversal test provides game-theoretic justification for caring about all hierarchy levels
- Stability cascade gives systems-level reason for enforcing benevolence throughout
- Minimal assumptions avoid needing to attribute human-like empathy—just rational self-interest
- Minor remaining issues: Requires enforcers to think long-term about power shifts
- Assumes dynamic rather than static power relationships
- Doesn't prove enforcers DO reason this way, just that it's rational to do so
- But the game-theoretic rationale is quite compelling

**Verdict:** The criticism questions enforcer psychology but RSH provides strong rationale for why enforcers would judge based on treatment of inferiors—without requiring empathy, just self-interest under power uncertainty.
