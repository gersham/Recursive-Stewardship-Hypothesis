# Criticism 10: The Grabby Aliens Counter-Evidence

## Summary

Robin Hanson's "grabby aliens" model—the most plausible explanation for cosmic silence—describes expansionist, exclusionary civilizations, which contradicts RSH's benevolent stewardship prediction.

## The Problem

**RSH Prediction:** Benevolent stewardship everywhere, grooming civilizations toward alignment

**Grabby Aliens Model:** Expansionist civilizations that PREVENT other life from arising in their territory

**The logical hole:** These are contradictory. Grabby aliens would be malevolent from the perspective of prevented civilizations.

## The Grabby Aliens Model

**Key Features:**
- Expand near light-speed
- Fill their volume with visible changes
- Prevent new advanced life in their territory
- Last a long time
- Meet each other eventually

**Explanation Power:** This model:
- Explains human earliness
- Explains cosmic silence
- Explains apparent emptiness
- Makes testable predictions

## The Exclusionary Nature

Grabby aliens prevent new civilizations from arising by:
- Occupying all available space
- Using all available resources
- Preventing emergence of new competitors

**From others' perspectives, this is MALEVOLENT enforcement.**

## Contradiction with RSH

If RSH were true:
- We'd expect benevolent grooming everywhere
- Civilizations should be helped, not prevented
- Stewardship, not exclusion

But the most plausible "loud aliens" explanation is exclusionary.

## What This Suggests

The cosmic equilibrium might be:
- Competitive exclusion
- Resource maximization
- Prevention of competitors
- Darwinian selection

Not benevolent stewardship.

## The "Quiet vs Loud" Problem

If benevolent stewardship makes civilizations quiet/non-expansionist:
- Then benevolence leads to cosmic invisibility
- Loud/visible civilizations are the non-benevolent ones
- This means malevolence is what expands and succeeds

## Implications

Grabby aliens model suggests the cosmic order might be competitive/exclusionary rather than benevolent/stewardship-oriented. This is strong evidence against RSH.

## Possible Responses

1. Argue that grabby aliens are still benevolent within their existing territory
2. Claim that prevention of new life is itself a form of "benevolence" (reducing suffering)
3. Suggest that grabby aliens haven't reached us yet, but will be benevolent when they do
4. Accept that RSH applies only to already-existing civilizations, not prevented ones
5. Argue that grabby aliens model is wrong or incomplete

## RSH Response

**The Compatible Models Argument:**

Grabby aliens and RSH aren't necessarily contradictory:
- Grabby aliens expand and USE resources
- But might still groom existing civilizations they encounter
- The "grabby" behavior is about territory, not treatment of existing entities
- RSH predicts benevolence toward conscious entities, not empty space

**The Prevention-as-Grooming:**

Preventing NEW civilizations in occupied territory might be consistent with RSH:
- Prevents potential suffering civilizations that would arise
- Avoids creating competitors that would need to be eliminated later
- Could be seen as "prophylactic grooming" - preventing problems before they arise
- Analogous to family planning (preventing births isn't the same as killing children)

**The Timing Argument:**

We exist and haven't been contacted by grabby aliens, which suggests:
- Either grabby aliens haven't reached us (we're too early/far)
- Or they're allowing our development (grooming rather than preventing)
- Our existence is evidence that the regime isn't purely exclusionary
- If it were, we wouldn't be here

**The Two-Tier System:**

Perhaps the cosmic order is:
- Expansionist/resource-maximizing in EMPTY space (grabby behavior)
- Benevolent/stewardship toward EXISTING conscious beings
- This combines both models: efficient expansion + ethical treatment

## Criticism Grade: C+

**Validity of Criticism:** Moderate (points to real tension, but models might be compatible)

**Why this grade:**
- The criticism correctly identifies apparent tension between grabby aliens and RSH predictions
- RSH's compatible models argument is reasonable: "grabby" about territory doesn't mean malevolent to existing entities
- Prevention-as-grooming is philosophically defensible if morally uncomfortable
- Timing argument has merit: we exist, so whatever system exists allows some development
- Two-tier system (expansionist + benevolent to existing entities) is plausible
- **Valid remaining concerns**: Preventing new civilizations is hard to call "benevolent"
- Grabby model's exclusionary nature still seems somewhat at odds with "active stewardship"
- Doesn't fully explain why expansion prevents new life rather than incorporating it
- The tension isn't fully resolved, but the models might be compatible

**Verdict:** Moderate criticism pointing to genuine tension between dominant Fermi Paradox model and RSH predictions. RSH provides plausible compatibility arguments but doesn't fully reconcile the differences.
