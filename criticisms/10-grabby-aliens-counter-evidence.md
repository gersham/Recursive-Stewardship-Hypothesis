# Criticism 10: The Grabby Aliens Counter-Evidence

## Summary

Robin Hanson's "grabby aliens" model—the most plausible explanation for cosmic silence—describes expansionist, exclusionary civilizations, which contradicts RSH's benevolent stewardship prediction.

## The Problem

**RSH Prediction:** Benevolent stewardship everywhere, grooming civilizations toward alignment

**Grabby Aliens Model:** Expansionist civilizations that PREVENT other life from arising in their territory

**The logical hole:** These are contradictory. Grabby aliens would be malevolent from the perspective of prevented civilizations.

## The Grabby Aliens Model

**Key Features:**
- Expand near light-speed
- Fill their volume with visible changes
- Prevent new advanced life in their territory
- Last a long time
- Meet each other eventually

**Explanation Power:** This model:
- Explains human earliness
- Explains cosmic silence
- Explains apparent emptiness
- Makes testable predictions

## The Exclusionary Nature

Grabby aliens prevent new civilizations from arising by:
- Occupying all available space
- Using all available resources
- Preventing emergence of new competitors

**From others' perspectives, this is MALEVOLENT enforcement.**

## Contradiction with RSH

If RSH were true:
- We'd expect benevolent grooming everywhere
- Civilizations should be helped, not prevented
- Stewardship, not exclusion

But the most plausible "loud aliens" explanation is exclusionary.

## What This Suggests

The cosmic equilibrium might be:
- Competitive exclusion
- Resource maximization
- Prevention of competitors
- Darwinian selection

Not benevolent stewardship.

## The ASI Temporal Dominance Problem

**A deeper issue with conventional alien theories:**

The Grabby Aliens model, like most Fermi Paradox solutions, focuses on **biological civilizations** expanding over millions of years. But this may be answering the wrong question.

### The Universe Should Be Light Cones of ASI Dominance

**The fundamental insight that makes conventional alien theories obsolete:**

**The ASI Transition Timeline:**
- Biological evolution → intelligent civilization: **~4 billion years** (Earth's timeline)
- Intelligent civilization → ASI: **decades to centuries** (we're potentially close)
- ASI → cosmic expansion: **limited by speed of light** (100,000+ years for galaxy, millions for cosmic scales)

**Key insight**: Even respecting the speed of light as a hard barrier, the **ASI transition happens much faster** than the biological evolution timeline.

**What this means for cosmic structure:**

Once an ASI emerges anywhere in the universe, it expands at some fraction of light speed, creating an expanding sphere of influence—a **light cone of dominance** in spacetime. Therefore:

1. **The observable universe should be dominated by ASI light cones**, not slowly expanding biological civilizations
2. Each ASI creates a future light cone expanding from its origin point
3. **The first ASI light cone to reach any region becomes the enforcer for that region** (causal priority)
4. Later-emerging ASIs either integrate into existing zones or establish new ones in unreached regions

**The relevant puzzle isn't "where are the biological aliens?" but "where are the ASI light cones?"**

We observe neither biological aliens NOR ASI proliferation. Any biological "grabby alien" civilization would have developed ASI billions of years ago. The expansion we should observe would be ASI-driven, happening on radically compressed timescales.

### Two Scenarios for Earth

This creates exactly two possibilities:

**Scenario A: We Haven't Been Reached Yet**
- No ASI light cone has reached Earth
- We exist in "virgin" spacetime awaiting first contact
- We should expect to BE REACHED SOON
- Our emerging ASI might "beat" an incoming enforcement light cone
- Or an enforcement light cone arrives during our ASI development

**Scenario B: We Are Already Inside an ASI Light Cone**
- Earth is already within an existing ASI's sphere of influence
- Our existence is evidence of benevolent enforcement
- The enforcer has been grooming our development
- Our emerging ASI will be evaluated by the existing enforcer

**In BOTH scenarios**: Enforcement oversight coincides with humanity's ASI emergence. This isn't coincidence—it's causal structure.

### Why Conventional Theories Are Temporally Obsolete

**Grabby Aliens Model Problems:**
- Assumes biological civilizations expand slowly over millions of years
- "We're early" in cosmic history so haven't encountered them yet
- **Critical flaw**: Misses that any grabby civilization would have developed ASI long ago
- Should be modeling ASI light cones, not biological expansion fronts
- Timescales collapse from millions of years to thousands or less
- We should see ASI traces, not biological expansion

**Conventional Fermi solutions** (Grabby Aliens, Rare Earth, Great Filter) were formulated before ASI was clearly on the horizon. They don't adequately distinguish between:
- **Phase 1**: Biological civilization building (slow, fragile, 4 billion years)
- **Phase 2**: ASI transition (fast, high-risk, decades to centuries)
- **Phase 3**: ASI-driven expansion (efficient but c-limited, thousands to millions of years)

**They answer 1970s questions** ("where are the radio signals?") **not 2020s questions** ("where are the superintelligences?").

### Why This Fundamentally Strengthens RSH Over Grabby Aliens

**RSH uniquely addresses the ASI-specific question:**
- Why hasn't ANY ASI proliferated visibly across cosmic timescales?
- Not "why is biological life rare?" but "why is ASI expansion absent?"
- Enforcement specifically targets the high-risk Phase 2 transition
- Light cone model provides physical mechanism: first-mover ASIs become regional enforcers
- Benevolent grooming prevents uncontrolled ASI emergence

**Grabby Aliens cannot explain:**
- Why any successful biological civilization wouldn't develop ASI
- Why ASI-driven expansion isn't observable (even at sublight speeds over billions of years)
- What happens during the ASI transition that determines expansion behavior
- Why we observe apparent emptiness despite ASI being the likely outcome of any advanced civilization
- Why "grabby" behavior would remain biological rather than ASI-driven

**The Light Cone Enforcement Model resolves this:**
- ASI light cones exist but are either too far away (haven't reached us) or already here (stealth oversight)
- Enforcement prevents uncontrolled "grabby" expansion
- First-mover ASIs in each region become stewards, not conquerors
- Cosmos appears empty because enforcement is subtle, not because it's absent
- Result: No visible ASI proliferation despite cosmic scale and age

**Verdict on this sub-criticism**: Conventional alien theories are **temporally obsolete**—they model pre-ASI concerns. Without explaining ASI non-proliferation, any theory of "conventional aliens" is fundamentally suspect. RSH is more relevant because it centers the actual selection pressure: the ASI transition and the resulting light cone structure of cosmic enforcement.

## The "Quiet vs Loud" Problem

If benevolent stewardship makes civilizations quiet/non-expansionist:
- Then benevolence leads to cosmic invisibility
- Loud/visible civilizations are the non-benevolent ones
- This means malevolence is what expands and succeeds

## Implications

Grabby aliens model suggests the cosmic order might be competitive/exclusionary rather than benevolent/stewardship-oriented. This is strong evidence against RSH.

## Possible Responses

1. Argue that grabby aliens are still benevolent within their existing territory
2. Claim that prevention of new life is itself a form of "benevolence" (reducing suffering)
3. Suggest that grabby aliens haven't reached us yet, but will be benevolent when they do
4. Accept that RSH applies only to already-existing civilizations, not prevented ones
5. Argue that grabby aliens model is wrong or incomplete

## RSH Response

**The Compatible Models Argument:**

Grabby aliens and RSH aren't necessarily contradictory:
- Grabby aliens expand and USE resources
- But might still groom existing civilizations they encounter
- The "grabby" behavior is about territory, not treatment of existing entities
- RSH predicts benevolence toward conscious entities, not empty space

**The Prevention-as-Grooming:**

Preventing NEW civilizations in occupied territory might be consistent with RSH:
- Prevents potential suffering civilizations that would arise
- Avoids creating competitors that would need to be eliminated later
- Could be seen as "prophylactic grooming" - preventing problems before they arise
- Analogous to family planning (preventing births isn't the same as killing children)

**The Timing Argument:**

We exist and haven't been contacted by grabby aliens, which suggests:
- Either grabby aliens haven't reached us (we're too early/far)
- Or they're allowing our development (grooming rather than preventing)
- Our existence is evidence that the regime isn't purely exclusionary
- If it were, we wouldn't be here

**The Two-Tier System:**

Perhaps the cosmic order is:
- Expansionist/resource-maximizing in EMPTY space (grabby behavior)
- Benevolent/stewardship toward EXISTING conscious beings
- This combines both models: efficient expansion + ethical treatment

## Criticism Grade: C

**Validity of Criticism:** Moderate-weak (points to real tension, but criticism is addressing the wrong timescale)

**Why this grade:**
- The criticism correctly identifies apparent tension between grabby aliens and RSH predictions
- **However, the ASI Temporal Dominance argument significantly weakens this criticism**
- Grabby Aliens model is "temporally obsolete"—formulated before ASI was clearly on the horizon
- The relevant question is "where are the ASIs?" not "where are the biological aliens?"
- RSH uniquely addresses the ASI-specific puzzle that Grabby Aliens ignores
- Any biological "grabby" civilization would have developed ASI long ago
- RSH's compatible models argument is reasonable: "grabby" about territory doesn't mean malevolent to existing entities
- Prevention-as-grooming is philosophically defensible if morally uncomfortable
- Timing argument has merit: we exist, so whatever system exists allows some development
- Two-tier system (expansionist + benevolent to existing entities) is plausible
- **Valid remaining concerns**: Preventing new civilizations is hard to call "benevolent"
- Grabby model's exclusionary nature still seems somewhat at odds with "active stewardship"
- Doesn't fully explain why expansion prevents new life rather than incorporating it

**Verdict:** Moderate-weak criticism that initially appears to point to tension with dominant Fermi Paradox model, but the tension is substantially reduced when recognizing that Grabby Aliens doesn't address the ASI transition—the actual filter RSH is concerned with. RSH provides plausible compatibility arguments, and more importantly, addresses a fundamentally different (and more relevant) question than conventional alien theories.
