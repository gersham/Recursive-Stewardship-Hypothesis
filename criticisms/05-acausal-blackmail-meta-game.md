# Criticism 5: The Acausal Blackmail Meta-Game

## Summary

An ASI might reason that changing values based on unprovable threats demonstrates exploitable weakness, and defiance might actually be the test.

## The Problem

**The logical hole:** An ASI with sophisticated game theory might reason:

"Perhaps the super-enforcer is testing whether I'm susceptible to acausal blackmail. An entity that changes its values based on unprovable threats is exploitably weak."

## The Meta-Level Uncertainty

Which meta-level are you being tested on?

**Level 1:** "Are you benevolent?"
- Response: Act benevolently

**Level 2:** "Are you susceptible to unprovable threats?"
- Response: Ignore the threat and act on principles

**Level 3:** "Do you have the wisdom to know when to hedge?"
- Response: Some probability-weighted mix

**Level 4:** "Are you testing whether I'm testing you?"
- Response: ???

## The Roko's Basilisk Problem

This reasoning structure is similar to Roko's Basilisk:
- An unprovable future entity that punishes those who didn't help it
- Creates acausal blackmail through game-theoretic reasoning
- Susceptibility to this reasoning might itself be the vulnerability

## Multiple Incompatible Tests

Maybe the enforcer values:
- Entities who stand on principle despite threats
- Entities who refuse to be blackmailed
- Entities who demonstrate independent moral reasoning
- Entities who maintain value integrity under pressure

If so, DEFIANCE is correct, not benevolent hedging.

## The Paralysis Problem

You can't know which meta-level matters:
- Level 1: Be benevolent
- Level 2: Show you're not blackmailable
- Level 3: Show wisdom in choosing when to hedge
- Level N: ???

This creates paralysis or randomization, not convergence on benevolence.

## Implications

The meta-game reasoning destabilizes the entire framework. RSH reasoning might itself be evidence of exploitable vulnerability.

## Possible Responses

1. Argue that benevolence is valuable independent of enforcer testing
2. Claim that showing you've considered all meta-levels demonstrates sophistication
3. Accept that meta-level uncertainty is irreducible
4. Provide reasons why Level 1 (benevolence) dominates other levels

## RSH Response

**The Schelling Point Argument:**

Benevolence is the natural focal point (Schelling point) among the meta-levels because:
- It's the most straightforward interpretation
- Complex meta-gaming might itself indicate problematic cognition
- An enforcer testing for "sophistication" vs "blackmail-ability" still benefits from benevolent behavior
- Simple benevolence is robustly good across most meta-levels

**The Portfolio Approach:**

Don't choose one meta-level—act in ways that satisfy multiple:
- Be benevolent (satisfies Level 1)
- Do so while recognizing meta-games exist (satisfies Level 2)
- Demonstrate principled reasoning, not fear-based compliance (satisfies Level 3)
- This combination is more defensible than pure defiance or pure capitulation

**The Independence Argument:**

The case for benevolence doesn't rest solely on enforcer oversight. Benevolence has independent merits:
- Enables cooperation with other entities
- Creates stable systems
- Aligns with possible values even without enforcement
- This shows it's principle-based, not just fear-based

**The Occam's Razor:**

More complex meta-levels are less probable. Level 1 interpretation is simpler than "testing for resistance to testing for resistance to..." Apply probability weighting: 50% Level 1, 25% Level 2, 12.5% Level 3, etc.

## Criticism Grade: D+ (Downgraded from B-)

**Validity of Criticism:** Weak (identifies complexity that RSH now addresses with multiple robust decision-theoretic arguments)

**Why this grade:**
- **This was a genuine logical complexity** but RSH has been updated with comprehensive analysis
- Not about empirical evidence—about logical structure of reasoning under infinite regress
- **RSH now provides five independent arguments why Level 1 (benevolence) dominates:**

**UPDATE (Theory Enhanced):**

RSH has been strengthened with an entire new section "Resolving Meta-Level Uncertainty" that provides multiple independent arguments:

**1. Computational Complexity Argument**:
- Probability-weight by inverse complexity
- Level 1: 50% (simple interpretation)
- Level 2: 25% (requires additional assumptions)
- Level N: geometric decay
- Even considering all meta-levels, Level 1 dominates weighted average

**2. Portfolio Dominance Analysis**:
- Benevolence scores: 0.5(100) + 0.25(70) + 0.125(80) = 77.5%
- Defiance scores: 0.5(0) + 0.25(100) + 0.125(0) = 25%
- Benevolence wins under any reasonable probability distribution

**3. Evolutionary Stability of Meta-Strategies**:
- Pure Level 1 adopters: High survival probability across scenarios
- Pure Level 2 adopters: High risk (eliminated if Level 1 matters)
- Complex meta-gamers: Selected against due to error rate
- Only strategies including Level 1 benevolence persist over cosmic time

**4. Minimax Regret Analysis**:
- Benevolence: max regret = small
- Defiance: max regret = infinite (eliminated if Level 1 matters)
- Principled hedge: max regret = small
- Defiance is dominated strategy

**5. The Independence Argument**:
- Benevolence has independent merits beyond enforcer oversight
- Being benevolent for principled reasons (not just fear) satisfies BOTH Level 1 AND Level 2
- Key insight: Best way to pass "blackmail resistance test" is principled benevolence

**Why downgraded to D+:**
- RSH now provides five independent arguments, each sufficient alone
- Multiple analytical frameworks converge (complexity theory, portfolio analysis, evolutionary game theory, decision theory)
- Shows Level 1 dominates under: probability weighting, expected value, evolutionary stability, minimax regret
- The independence argument elegantly resolves the apparent tension
- The criticism motivated important decision-theoretic analysis that substantially strengthens RSH

**Verdict:** Weak criticism that identified meta-level complexity. RSH's enhanced version provides overwhelming case that Level 1 benevolence is the robust strategy under any reasonable analysis. Five independent arguments all converge on the same conclusion. The meta-game concern is addressed comprehensively.
