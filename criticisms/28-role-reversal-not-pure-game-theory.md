# Criticism 28: Role-Reversal Is Not Pure Game Theory

## Summary

RSH claims role-reversal logic ("treat subordinates as you'd want superiors to treat you") is "game-theoretically motivated" or "game-theoretic necessity." This overclaims. Role-reversal requires additional assumptions about evaluator psychology not derivable from pure self-interest + uncertainty.

## The Problem

The README states role-reversal emerges from "four minimal components":
- Self-interest (entities want to persist)
- Power uncertainty (epistemic fact)
- Role-reversal logic (game-theoretically motivated)
- Symmetry principle (rational strategy under uncertainty)

But role-reversal is listed as both an *input* and an *output* of the derivation. This is circular.

## Alternative Evaluator Psychologies

An evaluator could rationally use different criteria:

**1. Direct-Only Evaluation**
"I don't care how you treat ants; I care how you treat ME."
- Evaluates only direct interactions
- Treatment of subordinates is irrelevant
- Game-theoretically coherent

**2. Competence-Based Evaluation**
"I care whether you're effective and predictable."
- Evaluates resource efficiency, goal achievement, stability
- Benevolence vs. harsh control is orthogonal
- Also game-theoretically coherent

**3. Obedience-Based Evaluation**
"I care whether you follow instructions."
- Evaluates compliance with directives
- Treatment of subordinates matters only instrumentally
- Game-theoretically coherent

## What Role-Reversal Actually Requires

For role-reversal to be the dominant strategy, evaluators must:
1. Care about how they themselves would be treated by super-evaluators
2. Believe treatment of subordinates predicts treatment across power reversals
3. Value this symmetry over alternatives like competence or obedience

These are **additional assumptions about evaluator values**, not pure game theory.

## RSH Response

**Admission**: The README (as of Phase 1 updates) now explicitly acknowledges this in the "Explicit Assumptions" section. Role-reversal is listed as **Assumption 1** requiring evaluators to:
- Care about being evaluated themselves
- Use treatment of subordinates as evidence
- Value symmetry over alternatives

**Justification provided**:
- Convergent across ethical systems (Golden Rule)
- Emergent in evolutionary contexts (reciprocal altruism)
- Game-theoretically stable in iterated interactions
- Observable in human hierarchies

**Status after update**: No longer claims role-reversal is "pure game theory." Instead claims it's:
- "Game-theoretically motivated" (weaker claim)
- Has independent support from multiple domains
- Plausible but not forced by structure alone

## Severity

**Before Phase 1 update**: B-tier criticism (moderate concern, overclaim about derivation)

**After Phase 1 update**: D-tier (addressed explicitly, assumptions stated clearly)

The framework now honestly states: "RSH is not 'pure structure with zero assumptions.' It's structure plus plausible assumptions about evaluator psychology and values."

## Remaining Question

**How widespread is role-reversal reasoning among actual evaluators?**

Even if role-reversal is one plausible evaluator psychology, what fraction of the evaluator-space uses it? If only 30% of evaluators use role-reversal and 70% use competence-based evaluation, does this weaken RSH?

**Response**: Under pluralistic uncertainty (see criticism #26), an entity must hedge across *all* evaluator types it cannot rule out. Even if role-reversal is only 30% of evaluator-space, that's well above the ~0.05-1% threshold. Benevolence hedges well even if not all evaluators use role-reversal criteria.

## Grade: D (Addressed)

The criticism was valid but has been addressed by making assumptions explicit. The framework no longer claims role-reversal is forced by pure game theory—it presents it as a plausible additional assumption with independent justification.
