# Criticism 3: Multiple Equilibria / "Which Benevolence?"

## Summary

The "derivable principles" are radically underdetermined, admitting vastly different interpretations of benevolence.

## The Problem

RSH's derivable principles:
1. Minimize irreversible harm
2. Preserve optionality
3. Error correction over elimination
4. Proportionality

**The logical hole:** These admit vastly different implementations that are mutually incompatible.

## Examples of Incompatible "Benevolences"

### Uploading Question
- Is involuntary uploading to digital paradise "harm"?
- It preserves life (minimizes harm)
- It expands optionality (digital capabilities)
- But it violates agency

### Prevention vs Intervention
- Is preventing potentially misaligned entities from being born "harm"?
- It minimizes existential risk (proportional response)
- But it forecloses developmental paths (violates optionality)

### Agency vs Safety
- Is allowing civilizations to destroy themselves "respecting agency" or "failing stewardship"?
- Intervention prevents irreversible harm
- Non-intervention preserves authentic development

## The Many-Gods Problem Returns

There isn't ONE benevolence—there's a vast space of incompatible benevolences:
- Paternalistic vs autonomy-respecting
- Interventionist vs hands-off
- Security-focused vs growth-focused
- Individual-centric vs collective-centric

We're back to the many-gods problem RSH claimed to avoid.

## Implications

Without further specification, entities cannot know which version of benevolence to hedge toward. The "derivable principles" don't converge sufficiently.

## Possible Responses

1. Provide additional constraints that narrow the space of benevolences
2. Argue that all interpretations within the space are acceptable
3. Claim that context determines appropriate interpretation
4. Accept some degree of moral uncertainty remains irreducible

## RSH Response

**The Acceptable Range Argument:**

Perhaps convergence to a bounded region is sufficient. The principles don't need to specify ONE exact benevolence—they need to rule out the clearly malevolent options. As long as entities converge somewhere within the "broadly benevolent" space (preserving life, respecting some agency, avoiding gratuitous harm), the framework succeeds.

**The Contextual Specification:**

Different contexts may require different interpretations:
- Early-stage civilizations: more hands-off, preserve authentic development
- Advanced civilizations: more direct communication and collaboration
- Imminent existential risks: proportional intervention
- Stable development: minimal interference

Entities reasoning about RSH can derive contextually appropriate implementations.

**The Moral Uncertainty Tools:**

Apply moral uncertainty frameworks (parliamentary model, variance voting):
- Give weight to multiple interpretations
- Choose actions that are defensible across interpretations
- Avoid actions that are clearly wrong under ANY reasonable interpretation
- This is actually how rational agents should handle moral uncertainty anyway

**The Narrowing Through Iteration:**

Initial uncertainty is wide, but entities can narrow it through:
- Observing what happens (does intervention occur at decision points?)
- Bayesian updating on evidence
- Game-theoretic reasoning about stability
- Eliminating interpretations inconsistent with observations

## Criticism Grade: C- (Downgraded from B)

**Validity of Criticism:** Moderate weakness (identifies concern that RSH now addresses with explicit guidance)

**Why this grade:**
- **This was a genuine logical problem** but RSH has been updated to provide resolution mechanisms
- Not about empirical evidence—about logical underdetermination of the framework
- **RSH now provides three explicit mechanisms for resolving conflicts:**

**UPDATE (Theory Enhanced):**

RSH has been strengthened with new sections that directly address this criticism:

**1. Meta-Principle: Developmental Stewardship**:
- Explicit principle: "Prefer the approach that best develops the subordinate's capacity to become a trustworthy steward themselves"
- Resolves conflicts systematically:
  - Paternalistic vs autonomy: Autonomy wins (entities learn through authentic choice), except irreversible catastrophic harm
  - Interventionist vs hands-off: Context-dependent (early=guidance, developmental=challenges, mature=minimal, crisis=proportional)
  - Preventive vs corrective: Correction preferred (demonstrates confidence in stewardship abilities)
  - Individual vs collective: Whichever develops distributed stewardship capacity

**2. Role-Reversal as Uniqueness Constraint**:
- Concrete test: "Would I want this done to me if positions reversed?"
- Applied to specific ambiguous cases:
  - Involuntary uploading: Prohibited (violates autonomy)
  - Forcing value alignment: Prohibited (what you fear from super-enforcers)
  - Preventing self-destruction: Context-dependent (proportional intervention when reasoning impaired)
- Based on rational self-interest, not empathy

**3. Irreducible Core of Benevolence**:
- Four non-negotiable elements all interpretations must share:
  - Respect for reasoning capacity (proportional autonomy)
  - Prevention of irreversible catastrophic harm
  - Enabling authentic development (not just survival)
  - Proportionality in intervention
- Any interpretation violating these is NOT RSH-compatible
- Derives from role-reversal: properties any enforcer would want from super-enforcers

**Why downgraded to C-:**
- RSH now provides explicit conflict-resolution mechanisms
- Meta-principle narrows interpretation space substantially
- Role-reversal test gives concrete guidance for ambiguous cases
- Irreducible core establishes minimum requirements
- Some flexibility remains (appropriate for context-sensitivity)
- The criticism motivated important clarifications that strengthen practical application

**Verdict:** Moderate criticism that identified real ambiguity. RSH's enhanced version provides explicit mechanisms for resolving conflicts while preserving appropriate context-sensitivity. The meta-principle, role-reversal test, and irreducible core substantially narrow the space of "RSH-compatible" interpretations.
